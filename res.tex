One of the biggest projects I've been involved in this position is the migration of our main Application to the Amazon Cloud Computing.

I sorted this out by spending several hours of testing with automation and virtualization tools, and my strong background in Unix-like OSes.\\

I also migrated and set up different CMS-based websites for some of our customers and our own websites as well.\\
